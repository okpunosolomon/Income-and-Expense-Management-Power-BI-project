The dataset used in this project, Project_Monthly_Performance_2019_2024.xlsx, captures six years of detailed financial performance data across multiple projects and departments. It provides a structured view of income and expenses between 2019 and 2024, serving as the analytical foundation for understanding budget efficiency, cost trends, and overall financial sustainability. The data was sourced from internal project performance records maintained in Excel, containing more than a thousand individual transaction entries.

Each record represents a monthly snapshot of project activity, including key financial metrics such as income and expense actuals, their corresponding budgets, and computed variances. Core fields include the project identifier, fiscal year, month, income and expense values (both actual and budgeted), performance variance, and remarks that offer context for adjustments or anomalies. Together, these fields create a complete view of how financial targets align with real outcomes across departments and time periods.

The cleaning and preparation process began in Microsoft Excel, where raw data was refined to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing numeric and currency formats. Dates were standardized, and calculated fields such as variance and percentage of budget were introduced to enhance analytical depth. Data integrity was verified across all fiscal years before being imported into Power BI.

Once inside Power BI, further transformation took place using Power Query. Columns were renamed for readability, data types were corrected, and key performance indicators such as Income Variance Percentage and Expense Variance Percentage were derived. Invalid or incomplete records were filtered out, and logical relationships between lookup tables and performance data were established to support efficient modeling and visualization.

The final dataset enables analysis of financial trends across a six-year period, helping to evaluate income and expense patterns, measure actuals against budget, and identify cost optimization opportunities. It also supports year-over-year comparisons, offering valuable insights for long-term financial planning and sustainability. Ultimately, this dataset forms the backbone of the Income and Expense Management Dashboard, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence that drives strategic business decisions.
